# Time Picker Project

My attempt at a flutter timesaver project. The original code was taken from https://github.com/Mindinventory/Flutter-review-page-interaction, where the scrolling wheel and animation capability comes from. It's still largely unfinished though. I tried tweaking the `ArcChooser` widget to be able to reuse it 3 times (1 for choosing the hour, 1 for the minutes, and 1 for the period of day). It didn't quite work out and I found myself just stacking ovals one on top of another. Also had trouble placing a `ListView` widget into the main Column widget in `main.dart` - kept breaking the app ðŸ˜…. Regardless, I did learn quite a bit about Flutter in the process.
